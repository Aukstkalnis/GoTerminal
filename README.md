# Description
Serial Port terminal written in GO (backend) and sciter (HTML/CSS/TIScript frontend). Project is under development. But development is very slow because of free time limitations and other stuff.

## Why new terminal?
There is no normal multiplatform multifunctional terminal in the world. So I decided to build one with modern looks and flexibility. At work my work I use Terminal v1.9b and hercules, but they are very annoying with their user interface and not maintained anymore. There is YET terminal, that is better then terminal v1.9b but it has an annoying user interface.

## Goals
Create serial port, UDP, TCP terminals and maybe more (thinking about SMS termnal and AT commands terminal). But first I will trie to develop serial port terminal. I chose GO because it is simple and fun to code. Since GO does not have normal multiplatform GUI library, I chose Sciter because it looks very flexible and easy to build modern GUI. There is QT, but it's very huge and I wanted something simple.
