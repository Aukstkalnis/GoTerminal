# Description
Serial Port terminal written in GO (background) and sciter (HTML/CSS/TIScript GUI). Project is under development. I desided to build some serios terminal with modern looks because current terminals are not supported or just do not meet my needs. For example Terminal v1.9 that is my right hand communicating with serial devices, Hercules that has very user unfriendly interface, but has TCP and UDP terminal. So my gol for this open source project to create terminal that has UDP, TCP, Serial and maybe more (thinking about SMS termnal and AT commands terminal). But for now I will be focusing on Serial terminal. I chose GO because I love this language and it will be easy to build TCP/UDP terminals. Sciter is modern GUI tool that uses HTML/CSS/TIScript to create frontend since GO has no real solution for GUI yet I think that it was the best choce. If someone found this project interesting and want to contribute, then do so :) I also encouraging you to suggest features that will make this tool more productive.
